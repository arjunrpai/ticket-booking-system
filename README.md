# Train Ticket Booking System

We have implemented a simple **Train Ticket Booking System** in **C++**, designed to simulate reservation, cancellation, and management of train tickets.  

This project demonstrates **OOP concepts, file handling, and data structures** in C++.



## Features
- **Train Management**
  - Each train has a unique ID, Name, Source, and Destination.  
- **User Management**
  - Each user has an ID, Name, Aadhaar Number, Age, and booking history.  
- **Reservation System**
  - Seats are stored in a 2D Reservation List (matrix).  
  - `1` â†’ Booked seat  
  - `0` â†’ Available seat  
- **Booking Service**
  - Book a ticket for a user.  
  - Cancel an existing booking.  
  - Print booking details.  
  - Save bookings to files for persistence.
